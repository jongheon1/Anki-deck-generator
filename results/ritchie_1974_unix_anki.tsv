I-node architecture	A data structure that separates file metadata and location information from the file's name and directory position	Enables multiple names for the same file and efficient file system operations by decoupling file identity from directory structure
UNIX provides a uniform interface to peripheral devices; each I/O device is treated by user programs as a file.	What principle makes this uniform interface possible?	Device abstraction	A design technique that hides hardware-specific details behind a common software interface	Simplifies programming by allowing the same file operations to work across different hardware devices

Why is the choice of implementation language significant for system design?	High-level implementation	The practice of implementing system software in portable, readable programming languages rather than assembly	Demonstrates that system performance and portability are not mutually exclusive, influencing decades of OS development
A process in UNIX corresponds to the execution of a program and exists in one of several states: running, waiting, runnable, sleeping.	What computational model does this state-based process representation enable?	Process state model	A formal representation of program execution that tracks the current condition and resource requirements of running programs	Provides the conceptual framework for process scheduling and resource management in multitasking systems
The directory structure is a rooted tree; each non-leaf node is a directory and contains a list of files or other directories.	How does this hierarchical organization solve file system management challenges?	Hierarchical namespace	A tree-structured organization system that provides unique paths to every file through nested directory relationships	Creates a scalable file organization method that supports both human understanding and efficient computer access
Files are sequences of bytes, with no further structure imposed by the system.	What philosophy about data representation does this design choice reflect?	Unstructured byte streams	A data model that treats files as simple sequences of bytes without imposing format restrictions	Maximizes flexibility by allowing applications to define their own data structures while simplifying system implementation
The memory management scheme is quite simple: when a process is to be run and there is insufficient memory, some process already in memory is swapped out onto the disk.	What trade-off does this simple memory management approach represent?	Simple memory management	A straightforward resource allocation strategy that prioritizes implementation simplicity over optimization	Shows how effective systems can emerge from simple, understandable mechanisms rather than complex optimization
System calls provide the interface between a process and the UNIX kernel.	What architectural principle does the system call interface demonstrate?	Kernel-user separation	A security and stability mechanism that separates privileged system operations from user program execution	Establishes the foundation for protected system operation and stable multi-user computing
The password file contains the user name, encrypted password, numerical user and group identification, and other information for each user.	How does this user management approach balance security with functionality?	User authentication system	A mechanism that verifies user identity while maintaining system security and enabling access control	Demonstrates early implementation of secure multi-user access control in computing systems
UNIX provides facilities for real-time processing and for multi-programming.	What computing paradigms does this capability enable?
